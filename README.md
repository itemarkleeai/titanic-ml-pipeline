# Titanic ML Pipeline

This project demonstrates a typical machine learning pipeline for the Titanic dataset, including:

- **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess data.
- **Model Training:** Train a Random Forest classifier.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Deployment:** Serve predictions via a Flask API.
- **Monitoring:** Track model performance over time.

Each step is separated into its own Python file for clarity and modularity.
